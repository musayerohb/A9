# Assignment 9:  A Programming Potpourri

Instead of a single project, this assignment includes a number of mini-projects on different topics.  You have the choice of four different projects to work on.  This document gives an overview of each one, but further details appear in the corresponding folders of this repl.

**Reminder for those doing pair programming:** Working in pairs is not an invitation to divide the projects between partners and each work on just two.  When you choose the pair programming option, you are expected to [work together](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/02/06/how-to-pair-program-effectively-in-6-steps/) and collaborate on all development.

## Mini-Project #1:  The Fractal Dragon and Friends

For this project you will write recursive code that draws various fractal shapes on the screen.  The window-handling software is already written for you; your challenge is to compute the correct points and design the drawing method in a recursive fashion.

## Mini-Project #2:  Building A Better BST

For this project you will extend the `BinaryTree` base class to make a new `BST` class implementing binary search trees.  As in the list assignment we have provided an interface with the methods that your class should provide.

## Mini-Project #3:  Great Recursive Conversions

We mentioned in one of the videos that it is possible to recursively transform a binary tree into an equivalent doubly-linked list ordered according to the inorder traversal (any of the three traversal orders, actually).  For this project you will actually implement such a transform method.  Going the other way, you will also implement a method to construct a balanced binary tree out of an array (as demonstrated in class).

## Mini-Project #4:  Heaps of Fun

In this mini-project you will develop an array-based heap implementation, and use it to implement the in-place heapsort algorithm.
