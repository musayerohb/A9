Reflections

Eva: What went well with this assignment was our pacing strategy in terms of switching between projects when parts of certain ones became difficult. We were worried that we'd get too caught up on a single project and wouldn't be able to make headway on the other projects, which would prevent us from getting closer to finishing the assignment. We found that we struggled with the bubbleUp and bubbleDown functions as we were getting mixed up on the conditionals of if they should bubble up and down when the left child was larger than the right child or vice versa. Something we plan on taking to the final assignment is the idea of slowly making progress at multiple places in our program, rather than attempt to brute force our way through a single part even when we get stuck. This would likely allow us to gain a greater understanding of how each part of our program is connected, as well as give us the opportunity to change parts of our program sooner and work backwards when debugging more easily.

Musa: Honestly, what went pretty well for this assignment was being strategic with what projects we worked on. WWhen we were
feeling worried about getting far on one and trying to finish it, we decided to try and grab points elsewhere in the assignment.
In the end, this really catered to our strengths because when we struggled with BST, we moved on to doing Heaps (which I was 
personally worried about doing, because I didn't understand it really well from class), but that ended up being a good idea as
we were able to finish the whole class to the best of our ability (which helped me understand heaps more). 

What we struggled with a bit was doing in-place sorting, we remembered it from class but it was a bit tough to wrap our head around in terms of implementation when doing heap sort. Eventually though, we understood how to just work with the size of the heap we currently had in heapsort and just swap elements around and use the methods we already made to mess around with the heap without editing its size. In future projects, I hope to be more effective with my methods. I liked how in this assignment we simplified our methods by just making new ones to cover different parts of one method. For example, swapping elements (for heapsort) was its own method here. This made it easier to see what we were doing and what was going wrong with our code when bugs arose.
